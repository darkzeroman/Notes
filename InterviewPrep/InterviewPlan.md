##### Interview Tips

* Write code in classes (if using Java or another OOP)
* Write test cases (a few before and after)
* Don't dive right in, think about the problem
* Communicate all your thoughts
* Regarding your speech:
	* Talk slow but be concise
	* Eye contact to make sure the interviewer is following your ideas
	* Talk about positive things (like What's a feature you're proud of?)
* Ask for feedback (don't expect it)

##### Problem Solving

* Always have a plan
* Restate the problem
* Divide the problem into subprobllems
* Start with what you know
* Reduce the problem into an easier one with simpler constraints if stuck
* Looking for analogies or similarities to other problems
* Experiment with a few strategies
* Don't get frustrated

##### UCTWV (Vidhur's Method)
* **U**nderstand the problem.
* **C**larify anything confusing, ask about boundary cases.
* **T**est Cases should be written before writing the actual code.
* **W**rite the code.
* **V**alidate the code with the test cases.
